## RedM Collective

While Cfx Rockstars maintains RedM, they do not actively support it or intend to, leaving a gap that our community has stepped in to fill leaving us no choice.

Reverse engineering and addressing server issues require significant time and expertise. These challenges have discouraged many skilled developers from contributing without proper support, especially when it comes to RedM.

By pooling donations, we aim to support developers who can enhance and fix RedM, ultimately improving the experience for all users suffering from numerous issues or a lack of features.

We also hope this initiative encourages Cfx to honour their commitment to maintaining RedM more proactively.

## The Goal
We all want RedM to be more playable and stable, with fewer crashes and more features. Cfx Rockstars are not supporting RedM, leaving players to deal with bugs like disappearing animals when you kill them, freezing wagons, invisible players etc. By donating, you help pay developers to try fix these problems and improve RedM for everyone.
